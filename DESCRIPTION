Description: an R package that implements the Scalable and Accurate Implementation of Generalized mixed model that uses the saddlepoint approximation (SPA)(mhof, J. P. , 1961; Kuonen, D. 1999; Dey, R. et.al 2017) and large scale optimization techniques to calibrate case-control ratios in logistic mixed model score tests (Chen, H. et al. 2016) in large PheWAS. SAIGE can take dosage files in either bgen format and plain text format. Estimated effect sizes are provided. Support VCF,BCF and SAV as input format using the SAVVY library. QR decomposition for the covariate matrix. Allow models with no covariates. Allow using large number of genetic markers to construct GRM (e.g. > 600,000 markers). Fixed a Bug for the Tstat output. Use coefficent of variations for trace estimators and variane ratio estimation. Fixed a bug for colSums() when there is no covariate. BETA and Tstat are now for the alt allele for both quantitative and binary traits. Added an option for leave-one-chromosome-out (LOCO), cut off for the coefficient of variation for trace estimates and variance ratio estimates. Update the savvy library. conditional analysis and gene-based test with sparse GRM. Add option for categorical variance ratio and sparseSigma for single-variant analysis for quantitattive traits. (bianry traits needs more work). Add step 1 using GMMAT package. update savvy library and debug the gene tests when no sparse matrix is used
