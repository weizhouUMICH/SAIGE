            <b>This page documents v1.0 of the BGEN format, which is now deprecated.</b>
			<em>This format should not be used for new files.  See <a href="bgen_format.html">here</a> for the most recent
				version of the BGEN format.</em>
            </p>
            <p>Note: The data layout documented here has the limitation that alleles can be only 1 character long.
            This prevents its use with (for example) the latest 1000 genomes data release, which contains structural variants many kilobases long.
            <a href="bgen_format.html">Version 1.1</a> was developed to be backwards-compatible with this format, and addresses this issue.

<h3>SNP block format</h3>
<p>
	Each snp block in a BGEN v1.0 file consists of the following data in order.
</p>
<center>
<table class="filespec">
	<thead>
	<tr><th>No. of bytes</th><th>Description</th></tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
	<tr><td>4</td><td>The number of individuals the row represents, hereafter denoted <em>N</em>.
		This is an integer encoded in two bytes.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>1</td><td>An unsigned integer <em>S</em>, indicating the length of the storage used for the
    SNPID and RSID fields in the row.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>1</td><td>The length, <em>SNPID_size</em> of (the data part of) the SNPID string.
		This must be between 0 and <em>S</em>.</td></tr>
	<tr><td><em>S</em></td><td>The SNPID of the row.  
		Only the first <em>SNPID_size</em> bytes will be used.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>1</td><td>The length, <em>RSID_size</em> of (the data part of) the RSID string.
			This must be between 0 and <em>S</em>.</td></tr>
	<td><em>S</em></td><td>The RSID of the row.  
		Only the first <em>RSID_size</em> bytes will be used.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>1</td><td>
		The chromosome on which the SNP is found, encoded as an unsigned 8-bit integer.
		The encoding is:

			<tr><td>23</td><td>SNP lies in the non pseudo-autosomal part of the X chromosome.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>24:</td><td>SNP lies in the non pseudo-autosomal part of the Y chromosome.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>253:</td><td>SNP lies in the pseudo-autosomal region of the X/Y chromosomes.</td></tr>

			<tr><td>255:</td><td>Indicates the chromosome is unknown.  We advise that this only be used for test data.</td></tr>

	<tr><td>4</td><td>The SNP position, encoded as an unsigned 32-bit integer.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>1</td><td>The length <em>LA</em>of the 'A' allele, encoded as an unsigned 8-bit integer.</td></tr>

    the cohort.  If the <em>CompressedSNPBlocks</em> flag is not set, this field consists of <em>P</em>=6*<em>N</em> bytes representing the probabilities.
 	If <em>CompressedSNPBlocks</em> is set, this field contains a 32-bit unsigned integer specifying the length of the compressed data,
	followed by the compressed data itself.  See below for more details.</td></tr>

<h3>SNP block probability data</h3>
<p>
		The probability data is listed as a sequence of 2-byte signed integers.  These should be interpreted in triples,
		the first member being the probability of AA, the second the probability of AB, the third the probability of BB.
		Altogether these occupy 6*<em>N</em> bytes where <em>N</em> is the number of samples.  These 6 * <em>N</em> bytes are written directly.
<b>Alternatively</b>, if the <em>CompressedSNPBlocks</em> flag is set in the header, these 6 * <em>N</em> bytes are first compressed using <a href="http://www.zlib.net/">zlib</a>.
The SNP block then contains a 4-byte integer representing the length of the compressed data followed by the compressed data itself.
</p>
<p>
		To convert the stored 2-byte integers into probabilities, the following calculation should be performed:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Convert the number into a floating-point format (e.g. float or double).</li>
		<li>Divide by 10,000.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		Note that the range of a two-byte unsigned integer is 0 - 65535 inclusive. Thus the resulting probabilities
        can take on values between 0 and 6.5535 inclusive and are accurate to four decimal places.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Note</b>: to convert a floating point number to the format, do the following:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Check the number lies in the half-open interval [ 0, 6.55355 ).</li>
		<li>Multiply by 10000 and round to the nearest integer.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		All numbers are stored in little-endian (least significant byte first) order.
