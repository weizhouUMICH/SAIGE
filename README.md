SAIGE is an R package that implements the Scalable and Accurate Implementation of Generalized mixed model that uses the 
saddlepoint approximation (SPA)(mhof, J. P. , 1961; Kuonen, D. 1999; Dey, R. et.al 2017) 
and large scale optimization techniques to calibrate case-control ratios in logistic mixed model score tests
(Chen, H. et al. 2016) in large PheWAS. SAIGE can take dosage files in either bgen format and plain txtformat
